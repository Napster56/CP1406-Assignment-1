CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan

Name: Tyrone Napoli

Goals

The website is intended to improve business for Slammers Beach Volleyball by increasing the customer base by at least 50%. This will be achieved by promoting its services to
a younger audience, who will then sign up online to play. Additionally, the website will promote the benefits of volleyball - fun and fitness, to young families.

Success Evaluation

The success of the website will be measured primarily by the percentage increase in the number of customers who sign up to play with Slammers.
If the increase is a minimum of 50%, then the goal has been achieved.

Target Audience

The target audience for the Slammers Beach Volleyball website is young people, aged from 15 -30 years. In particular, the website should appeal to
young people who are still in high school, aged from 13 - 18 years.

In order to attract young people, the site will have a minimum of written content, but display an attractive and energetic look by using images, backgrounds and colours that reflects the beach lifestyle.
The site will use prominent buttons for customers to easily identify how to sign up online.
