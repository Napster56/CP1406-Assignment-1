Goals

The goal of implementing the website is improve business for Slammers Beach Volleyball by increasing the customer base by at least 50%. This will be achieved by promoting its services to a younger audience, who will then sign up online to play. Additionally, the website will promote the benefits of volleyball - fun and fitness, to young families.

Success Evaluation

The success of the website will be measured by the percentage increase in the number of customers who sign up to play with Slammers. Online registrations via the form on the 'Join US' page will be counted and the percentage increase against the membership at the time the site goes live will be calculated. If the increase is a minimum of 50%, then the goal has been achieved.

Target Audience

The primary target audience for the Slammers Beach Volleyball website is young people, aged from 15 -30 years. Secondarily, the website should appeal to
young people who are still in high school, aged from 13 - 18 years.

In order to attract young people, the site will have a minimum of written content, but display an attractive and energetic look by using images, backgrounds and colours that reflects the healthy beach lifestyle.
The site will use prominent buttons for customers to easily identify how to sign up online.
