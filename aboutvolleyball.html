    <h4>Popularity</h4>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>There are 800 million players worldwide who play Volleyball at least once a week.</li>
        <li> Volleyball ranks second, behind only soccer among participation sports.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Background</h4>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Volleyball is a team sport played by two teams on a playing court divided by a net.</li>
        <li>Although the sport originated in the United States, it is only now achieving the type of popularity in
            the U.S. that it has received on a global basis.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Objective of the Game</h4>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Each team sends the ball regularly over the net, trying to ground it on the opponent's
            court whilst preventing the ball from being grounded on its own court.
        </li>
        <li>The ball is put into play by the right back-row player who serves the ball by hitting it over the net to the
            opponent's court.
        </li>
        <li>A team is allowed to hit the ball three times (in addition to the block contact) to return it to the
            opponent's court.
        </li>
        <li>A player is not allowed to hit the ball twice consecutively, except when attempting a block.</li>
        <li>The rally continues until the ball touches the ground/floor, goes "out" or a team fails to return it to the
            opponent's court or commits a
            fault.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Rally Point System</h4>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>The team winning a rally scores a point. When the receiving team wins a rally, it gains a point and the
            right to serve, and its players rotate one position clockwise.
        </li>
        <li>The best of three or best of five games will win matches.</li>
        <li>Each non-deciding game will be won by the team that first scores 25 points with a minimum two-point
            advantage (no scoring cap).
        </li>
        <li>If there is a deciding game, it will be won by the team that first scores 15 points with a minimum
            two-point advantage (no scoring cap).
        </li>
    </ul>
